# Area Under the Curve (AUC) of Hand-Drawn Graphs
An innovative solution for finding the area under the curve for hand-drawn graphs

## Solution
For the purposes of this demonstration, I will use a plot of blood pressures (similar to a record an anesthesiologist may keep during surgery). AUC of blood pressure readings is often a key measurement used in clinical research.

###### Step 1
Download [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html) distributed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

###### Step 2
Save the hand-drawn graph in `.png` format. Below is the graph to be used in this demonstration:

###### Step 3
Open ImageJ and navigate to `Files` > `Open` and choose the `.png` file saved from Step 2.

###### Step 4
Click on the `Polygon selections` tool in the toolbar and draw a polygon on the opened image around the region whose area you wish to determine.
